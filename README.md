# HospitalManagement

	-Project: Hospital Management
	-This project is a solo project that I made for my Database Systems course. I used Java, JavaFX, JDBC, and PostgreSQL
	-Description: This is a basic CRUD application. This application can be used to manage the information of the patients and of the operations in one hospital. Users have to be a hospital staff (nurse or doctor). Users can log in/out, add/delete or updating information, using the information in database to show the information corresponding to the requests the users want, and the users can change their password to a new password.
